# Overview
The "MultiplayerCloudGaming" project was created using MS Visual Studio 2015.

The "MultiplayerCloudGaming" project consists of two namespaces, namely MatchmakingProblem and ServerAllocationProblem, which are for simulating the Matchmaking Problem (connecting to our NetGames 2017 submission) the Server Allocation Problem (connecting to our TMM submission that is under major revision), respectively.
